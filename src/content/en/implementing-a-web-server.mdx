# Why I Decided to Implement My Own Web Server?

Many times I've caught myself thinking that, as developers, we use incredible tools without truly understanding how they actually work.

It's worth mentioning: I don't think it's necessary to have a deep, academic understanding of absolutely everything you touch, but I believe that knowing the flow, the structure, and "how the magic happens" is what sets us apart.

### The Problem with Abstractions

Nowadays, we deal with several layers of abstraction (in my case, using Node.js and JavaScript frameworks). Realizing that I dealt with web requests daily, I decided to dedicate my studies to understanding what happens beneath these abstractions. And what's the best way to do that? **By implementing a web server from scratch.**

## Concepts and Challenges

When we set out to build something from the ground up, we end up strengthening fundamental concepts. Here are the main points I encountered on this journey:

### TCP, UDP and the TCP/IP Model

Understanding the transport layer is essential. **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)** and **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)** are the protocols that dictate how data travels. Before moving forward, it's worth presenting the main differences between them:

- **TCP (The "Reliable" One):**
    - Uses the **Three-way handshake** to establish connection.
    - Guarantees that data arrives complete and in the correct order.
    - It's a bit slower due to error control and acknowledgments (ACKs).
    - **Common uses:** Web browsing (HTTP), Email, File transfer.
- **UDP (The "Fast" One):**
    - No handshake ("fire and forget").
    - Doesn't guarantee delivery or packet order.
    - Much faster due to having less "bureaucracy" in transport.
    - **Common uses:** Video streaming, online gaming, and DNS.

An interesting point was noticing how the **TCP/IP** model simplifies the **OSI** model. While OSI has 7 layers, TCP/IP groups the first three (Application, Presentation, and Session) into a single **Application** layer, and the last two (Data Link and Physical) into a **Network Access** layer.

### What was most fun to learn:

- **Three-way Handshake:** The "handshake" process between client and server to establish a secure connection.
- **Buffers and Bytes:** How to handle requests using buffers and identify the end of a line by analyzing specific bytes (like `\r\n`).
- **Request Parsing:** Manually interpreting the HTTP verb (GET, POST), headers, protocol version, and message body.
- **Avoiding Backpressure:** Understanding how to manage data flow so the server isn't flooded with more information than it can process.

## Learning Overview

Beyond the technical topics, the biggest gain was strengthening my foundation on how the internet is structured. Today, I have a much clearer view of the path that data travels:

1. **The Client** builds a request in a specific format.
2. **The Server** receives this raw data, parses (interprets) it, and directs it to the business logic.
3. **The Response** is built and sent back through the same path.

Obviously, this is a simplified model, but understanding this "skeleton" is transformative. I don't know if I'll ever implement something this complex from scratch in production, but the knowledge gained gives me much more confidence to debug and optimize the tools I already use.
